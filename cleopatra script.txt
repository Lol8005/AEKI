So next is racism (show video); the current popular case that I'm going to bring up is the Queen Cleopatra documentary. In case someone doesn't know what is happening, I'm going to do some explaining. This documentary series was produced by Netflix and broadcast in 2023. It talks about one of the famous ancient Egyptian women, Pharaoh, who was basically a king and the last ruler of ancient Egypt. Well, it was very cool to hear about Women King because we had never heard this kind of history before, but this show was hated so much, as you can see from the rating; everyone hated it. And why do you ask? Watch this (show video). Ah, yes, the classic US political issueâ€”blackwashing. (show website) The expert in this video, 'Shelley', who claimed to be an expert on Cleopatra, just takes what her grandmother said and claims Queen Cleopatra is black. (black feminist) Oh, that's why. This is ridiculous. Documentaries are supposed to give accurate and unbiased information backed up by facts and evidence. Even the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, 'Mostafa Waziri, confirms that Queen Cleopatra had light skin and Greek+ features.

At the end of the day, why does this kind of incident happen? There are two main factors contributing to racism, and one of them is a lack of responsibility. (read slide) And other than that, there is systemic failure. (read slide)

Finally, the impact of racism in the Queen Cleopatra documentary. Direct impact (read QoP). Btw, this documentary annoyed all Egyptians; it got sued by an Egyptian lawyer and demanded 2 billion US dollars from Netflix for their claim that Queen Cleopatra is black. Then indirect impact (read slide).

That's all from Cleopatra. Now the next person will continue.
